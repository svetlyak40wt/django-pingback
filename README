This two applications provide 4 connected services: an XML-RPC server,
pingback server, pingback client and directory ping client.

Example of configuration of pingback server and pingback and directory ping
clients you can see inside a `pingback-connect-example.py`.

Don't forget to add this urlpattern to your urls configuration:

    url(r'^xmlrpc/', include('xmlrpc.urls'))

Directories ping require configuration in settings, example:

    DIRECTORY_URLS = (
        'http://ping.blogs.yandex.ru/RPC2',
        'http://rpc.technorati.com/rpc/ping',
    )
